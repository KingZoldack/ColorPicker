# Color Identifier
The Color Identifier is a simple color picker tool developed using WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) and C#. It allows users to identify and capture colors from any point on their screen. The application features a user-friendly interface with hex value displays, clear instructions, and a "Start" button to initiate the color picking process. A background thread continuously captures the color under the cursor, and users can press the Enter/Return key to trigger the capture, updating the UI with the selected color's hex value. Important instructions highlight that the application must remain open and in focus for the Enter/Return key to function properly.
